# windows-bootkit

A proof-of-concept bootkit that intercepts the windows boot process to execute a payload in kernel mode

---

## idea

the idea is to obtain kernel-mode execution for either r/w or other purposes
- by extending the shellcode and writing a usermode program you can achieve simple interface to r/w anti-cheat protected process memory

---

## compilation

expects EDKII folder within its .\ directory
to compile:
visual studio & msvc compiler
